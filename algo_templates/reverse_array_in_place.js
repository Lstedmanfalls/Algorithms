// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

// Strategy:
// 1) Swap the first and last values on first loop
// 2) Move the last value -1 for each loop

const reverseArr = (arr) => {
    let end = (arr.length -1)
    for (let i = 0; i <= end; i++){
        let temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[end]
        arr[end] = temp;
        end--
    }
    return arr;
}
console.log(reverseArr([5,4,3,2,1,0]))
