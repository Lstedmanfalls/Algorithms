// Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

// Strategy:
// 1) Swap the first and last values on first loop
// 2) Move the last value -1 for each loop

    var x = (arr.length -1)

        arr[x] = temp;

// Implement rotateArr(arr, shiftBy) that accepts array and offset. Shift arr's values to the right by that amount. 'Wrap-around' any values that shift off array's end to the other side, so that no data is lost. Operate in-place: given ([1,2,3],1), change the array to [3,1,2]. Don't use built-in functions. Second: allow negative shiftBy (shift L, not R). Third: minimize memory usage. With no new array, handle arrays/shiftBys in the millions. Fourth: minimize the touches of each element.

function arr2(arr, offset){
    for (var i = arr.length-1; i > 0; i--){

// Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One method is to eliminate values that lie outside of a specific known range. Given arr and values min and max, retain only the array values between min and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with values in original order. No built-in array functions.

function arr3(arr, min, max){
    //     Loop through the array
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){

        if (arr[i] <= min || arr[i] >= max){
            // move all values after current index to the left (-1) by looping  
            // To move each value that is out of range to the end to be chopped off

// Replicate JavaScript's concat(). Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays. Return a new array containing the first array's elements, followed by the second array's elements. Do not alter the original arrays. Ex.: arrConcat( ['a','b'], [1,2] ) should return new array ['a','b',1,2].
